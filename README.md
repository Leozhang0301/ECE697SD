# Background
Mixed Reality systems can teleport a participant to a remote physical location
enhanced with virtual overlays to provide spatial context. The goal is to enhance content sharing
and ease collaboration. To enable this, 360 cameras capture the physical environment and overlay
virtual content on the captured video stream. The high fidelity 360-video provides better
collaboration and a high sense of telepresence compared to traditional display systems. View
independence between the local and remote user improves the speed of collaboration. 360-video
only teleports physical setup and co-located users to remote users. The goal is to overlay virtual
objects precisely on the 360-videos, and track those overlays as the scene changes.

# Goal
Stream the panoramic view of a physical space from one 360-camera to a VR headset. Also
overlay virtual objects on the camera stream.
